## The Black Hole Group Operations Dashboard
Built for the makers of Tipo Pasta, Afterwit, The Great Mischief etc, this dashboard was born out of a one-month internship I had with the group. I ideated and executed this dashboard to further increase and drive group revenue via the following specific tools. By the end of the internship, I was able to contribute a five-figure sum revenue directly from the usage of these tools.

# Sevenrooms Live Dashboard
Powered by a streamlit front-end with plotly graphs, this page links with Sevenrooms, a reservation and guest-seating platform to provide the Operations Department with a holistic overview of each restaurantâ€™s live occupancy. Dashboard was crucial especially during peak dinner nights to redirect customers to other restaurants under the group.

# Google + SR Reviews Page
Powered by a streamlit front-end, this page retrieves reviews for all 10 restaurants from both Google (via the Google Business API), and Sevenrooms (via self reverse-engineered API). Allows the company to have one dashboard to view, analyse and take action based on all their reviews.
